## Identifier and Keyword

### Identifier

can be formed by letter, number and _(low dash), and only can start with letter or `_` such as:

- abc

- _

- _123

- abc123

  >camelCase is suggested to use in `Go` such as:
  >
  >```go
  >var studentName string
  >```

### Keywords

go language has 25 keywords:

```go
break		default		func		interface 	select
case		defer 		go			map			struct
chan		else		goto		package		switch
const		fallthrough	if			range		type
continue	for			import		return 		var
```

and there are 37 reserved words:

```go
Constants:	true	false	iota	nil
Types:		int 	int8	int16	int32	int64
			uint	uint8	uint16	uint32	uint64	uintptr
			float32	float64	complex64	complex128
			bool	byte	rune	string	error
Functions:	make	len		cap		new		append	copy	close	delete
			complex	real	imag
			panic	recover
```



## Variables

### What is variable

The official definition: in computer programming, a variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier) which contains a value.

In other words, a variable is a storage location for data. Variables have names. Some computer language mandate you assign a data type to variables. When asked for the "official definition" (or best definition) please use the definition stated above.



### Variable in `go`

every variable in `Go` has its own type, and must determine before use

- you must use the variable after determine it
- can not determine the same variable name in the same scope



### Determine `single` variable

the standard format to determine a variable

```go
var VARIABLE_NAME VARIABLE_TYPE 
```

such as:

```go
var name string
var age int
var isOk bool
```



 ### Determine `multiple` variable

`go` support determine multiple  variable at the same time:

```go
var (
	a string
	b int
	c bool
	d float32
)
```



### Variable initialization

when determine variable in `go`, it will initialize the variable automatic by default. Each variable will be determined to the default value of its type, such as

- `int` :  `0`
- `string` : `''`
- `bool` : `false`
- `slice` , `func` : `nil`

the standard initialization format as following:

```go
var VARIABLE_NAME VARIABLE_TYPE = EXPRESSION
```

for example:

```go
var name string = 'Alex Zhou'
var age int = 23
```



### Determine and initializing at the same time

```go
var s1 string = "Alex Zhou" // not suggest to use this
```



### Type Derivation

`Go` will set the type for variable according to the type of initial data

``` go
var s2 = "Alex"
```



### Short variable declaration

> only able to use inside of the function

```go
s3 := "Acadia University"
```



### Anonymous variable

when assigning multi variable, us `anonymous variable`to ignore useless variable. 

`anonymous variable` is `-`

Example:

```go
func foo()(int, string){
	return 10, "abcde"
}
func main(){
	x,_ := foo()
	_,y := foo()
}
```

### Demo program

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var(
	name string
    age int
    isHungry bool
)

func foo()(int, string){
	return 10, "abcde"
}

func main(){
    name = "Alex Zhou"
    age = 23
    isHungry = true
    // unglobal variable in Go lan must be used, or the compiler will give error 
    fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old, if he is hungry: %t\n", name, age, isHungry)
    fmt.Print("Age: ", age)
    fmt.Println("Name: ", name)

    // Determine and initializing at the same time
    var s1 string = "Alex Zhou" // not suggest to use this
    fmt.Println(s1)

    // Type Derivation
    var s2 = "Alex"
    fmt.Println(s2)

    // Short variable declaration
    // only able to use inside of the function
    s3 := "Acadia University"
    fmt.Println(s3)

    x,_ := foo()
    fmt.Println(x)
    _,y := foo()
    fmt.Println(y)
}
```



## Constant

### `const`

`const` usually use for global, constant must initialize when determine it, such as:

``` go
const pi = 3.1415926
const e = 2.7182
```

after determine `pi` and `e` they will never change during the running of the program



you can determine multi `const` together:

``` go
const(
	pi = 3.1415926
    e = 2.7182
)

const(
	d1, d2 = 1, 2
    d3, d4 = 3, 4
)
```



if `const` doesn't have value, it means this `const` has the same value as above:

``` go
const (
	n1 = 100
    n2
    n3
)
```



### iota

`iota` is a counter of `const`, only be able to use inside the `const` determination.

`iota` will reset to `0` when `const` show up, each **line** in the `const` determination will increase the `iota` by `1`. Such as:

``` go
const (
	n1 = iota // 0
    n2	// 1
    n3	// 2
    n4	// 3
)

const (
	c1 = iota // 0
    c2 = 100
    c3 = iota // 2
    c4	// 3
)
```

#### iota skip value

``` go
const (
	b1 = iota	// 0
    b2	//1
    _	
    b3 // 3
)
```

#### use case: Define order of magnitude

``` go
const (
	_ = iota
    KB = 1 << (10 * iota)
    MB = 1 << (10 * iota)
    GB = 1 << (10 * iota)
    TB = 1 << (10 * iota)
    PB = 1 << (10 * iota)
)
```
